-- Now, we need a more detailed information about categories â€“ count of game, average budget and max rating.
-- Select all categories names, count of the games from each category, 
-- the average budget (rounded to the second digit after the decimal point) of all games from the current category
-- and the max rating of games from a category.
-- Order the result by count of games in descending order, then by the name of the category alphabetically. 
-- Skip categories with max rating lower than 9.5(exclusive).
