-- Make it easier for students when they are searching for a new university. 
-- From the database extract the university_name, city_name, address, price_rank and tuition_fee. 
-- If the tuition fee is less then 800 (exclusive) the user must see "cheap",
-- 						equal or above 800 and less than 1200 it should display "normal",
--                         equal or above 1200 and less than 2500 it should display "high" 
--                         and equal or above that it should display "expensive".Â  
-- Order the results ascending by tuition_fee.
